#### Introduction to _Not-So-Graceful_ Gracee, Catahoula Leopard Dog


---

It wasn't a moment, really.  It was just a glance. She was looking at me with such energy, as if to tell me, "Let's go! I'll go with you! Where should we go?" She looked so motivated, so ready at any moment, to just go. She trusted me to take her, somewhere fun, somewhere to have a good time. In that moment that wasn't really a moment, I found something that would eventually help me out way more than I expected. This was the day I adopted Gracee. I soon learned that she had some specific traits, quirks, if you will. After some research and joining a Catahoula Leopard Lovers facebook group, I learned that her quirks were common to her breed. These are the traits that I love about my dog.

First, Gracee loves to **run**. It doesn't matter how many times she gets scolded for running out the front door and losing herself in our neighborhood. Every time I chased her down and found her she would have this _can't catch her breath, tongue hanging out, joyful smile_ on her face. 

Second, she has what I call the **catahoula lean**. She sits on our couch, with her front legs stiff as a board pushing against the seat cushion and leans back against the couch. But, she doesn't just lean on the couch, she'll lean on you just like this if you are the only option. She won't just sit next to you, she pushes herself against you.

Last, she is so **intelligent**. She is very food driven, so she'll do anything, and I mean anything, for a morsel of human food. In addition to the standard tricks - sit, stay, shake, leave it - I have taught her to _wipe her paws_ clean after coming inside when it's raining.
