all about catahoula dogs

The purpose of this file is to give some insight to the catahoula leopard dog breed. I adopted a catahoula leopard dog about a year ago and I would like to share the incredible traits of the breed. In addition to providing some education on the breed, I am going to share my own experiences with my Catahoula, Not-So-Graceful Gracee.  I am also going to plug in support of adopting misplaced animals from rescue organizations.
